Product Description

AltAir is an IoT sensor characterized by a PCB board containing CO2, temperature, relative humidity, and illumination sensors. The board has a microcontroller that features Wi-Fi and BLE connectivity and is powered via a USB type C port or a single-cell Li-Po battery. AltAir is equipped with two unused but available I2C ports for potential expansions, which are not exposed outside of the case. The case consists of a main structure, a sliding structure that acts as a closure, and two buttons, RESET and BOOT.

Configurazione

Ensure that AltAir is charged by pressing the RESET button once. 

If the sensor is charged, a green LED will light up inside the cloud.



If the sensor is not charged, connect it to a 5V max 2A USB power adapter, using a USB Type C cable.

After charging the sensor, press the RESET button and check that the green LED inside the cloud lights up.

The AltAir board is configured for data transmission and connection to a Wi-Fi network through a captive portal. Below, we will see the steps for the configuration.


press RESET

press BOOT









Use your smartphone, tablet, or computer with Wi-Fi connection.


Search for the Wi-Fi network named "AltAir Configuration Portal."
















From this moment, a captive portal for the configuration of AltAir will be activated on the chosen device, be it a smartphone, tablet, or computer.

If the portal does not automatically appear after selecting the "AltAir Configuration Portal" Wi-Fi network, open your web browser (Google Chrome, Safari, Opera, etc.), and the portal will appear within your web browser.




J. WiFi SSID field of the portal > Enter the name of the Wi-Fi network you want to connect the sensor to.

K. PASSWORD field of the portal > Enter the password of the Wi-Fi network you want to connect the sensor to.

The Dashboard TOKEN Field can be found, scanned, and copied from the QRCode inside the sensor's box. The TOKEN has a format similar to this:

 altair_beta_kit/11f0a4fb-5b45-4cc0-b644-da21d6039a18 

(donâ€™t copy this is an example)







M. Once all the data has been entered, select from the dropdown menu at the bottom the sampling frequency, that is, how many minutes the sensor should send the data. It is recommended to use 15 minutes for optimized use of the 2000mah battery.







N. After completing step M, press SUBMIT, and if you see the blue LED light up, the configuration has been successful. If the LED is red, it will be necessary to repeat the operation.





In case you want to reset the sensor to change its password and Wi-Fi, it will be possible at any time to perform the procedure from point A to point N and reconfigure the board with a new SSID, Wi-Fi network name, and PASSWORD, Wi-Fi network password.


Power Supply

AltAir must not be exposed to open flames or direct heat sources. The sensor requires 4 hours for a full charge and it is advised that it be connected exclusively to USB power adapters of 5V 0.5-2A. It can operate continuously while connected to the power cable.
